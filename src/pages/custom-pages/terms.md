Each individual may purchase only one ticket. Tickets for RDC are for the full two-day conference and no single-day tickets are available.



RDC tickets must be used by the original registrant and are non-transferable.



Tickets may not be sold, bartered, auctioned, or transferred in any way and doing so may result in Roblox rendering the ticket null and void without any responsibility to Roblox.



Attendees must be at least 16 years of age to attend RDC. 16- and 17-year-old attendees require an adult to accompany them. In addition, Roblox will not offer chaperone tickets for 16- and 17-year-old attendees.  If you require a chaperone, please contact [RDC22registration@fntech.com](mailto:RDC22registration@fntech.com) for consideration.



Attendees are not permitted to bring guests to RDC or to the after party. If you have someone traveling with you, they will need to register themselves and purchase an attendee ticket.

Photographs and/or video taken at RDC by Roblox, or others on behalf of Roblox, may include your image or likeness. You agree that Roblox may use such photographs and/or video for any purpose without compensation to you.



All information entered into the registration form must be correct and accurate to the best of your knowledge. All information must be entered in English. Some of the information entered (such as name, company) will be displayed on the attendee badge.



RDC badges may contain NFC, BLE, or other RFID technologies to help us serve attendees and determine participation in various sessions and activities.



All registered attendees agree to allow Roblox to contact them regarding their registration and attendance at the event. By purchasing a ticket, you agree to allow Roblox to communicate with you via email with information regarding the event.



Attendance at RDC is not allowed by the following: residents of embargoed countries, individuals ordinarily residing in embargoed countries, or individuals otherwise prohibited by applicable export controls and sanctions programs.
