Camp Strava is an annual event that gathers the global Strava community in one place for a chance to connect, learn from each other and move together.

It will bring together 300 of the world’s most inspiring athletes, explorers, community builders, event organizers and brands to tackle the question of what the active community of tomorrow could—and should—look like. The day will be packed with camaraderie, conversation and plenty of time for activity.
