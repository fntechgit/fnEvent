**What is an FNid?**

*Your FNid is a set of credentials that authenticates you as a user of the FNvirtual Event Platform. When you create your FNid, you enter basic info about yourself and create a password to protect your info. You will use your FNid to access all FNvirtual Events.*

* *You may also use a social login or request a one-time-use authorization code to be sent to your email. If you are registered for an event, please use the same email on your ticket in order to log in.*

**I created my FNid; why do I need to register for the event as well?**

*Creating an FNid and registering/purchasing an event ticket are two different things.*

* *Think of your FNid like a virtual ID card. These credentials tell the system you are you and permit access to FNvirtual registered events. (On the day of the event, you will simply log in with your FNid credentials; the system will know if you purchased an event ticket because it will be linked to your FNid.)*
* *When you register/purchase an event ticket, you are gaining access to the event itself. Just like you would not be permitted entry to an in-person event without your printed badge, you will not be allowed to enter an FNvirtual event without a valid virtual ticket to that specific event. This step must be completed prior to attending each event.*
* *Please use the same email address for each event by signing into your FNid account during the registration process.*
* *You may also use a social login or request a one-time-use authorization code to be sent to your email. If you are registered for an event, please use the same email on your ticket in order to log in.*

**Why am I being asked to allow the Virtual Event app to access my information after I log in for the first time?**

*In accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines, the website is providing details on how it may use your information. This is standard industry practice. You will only need to accept this set of permissions once.*

- - -

**Who will see the information in my FNid?**

*Your basic FNid information will become your attendee profile.*

* *The information you provide in your FNid will be shared with the event host and may be shared with select event sponsors, depending on the event’s opt-in policy. Please reach out to the event’s management team for more information.*

A. Please visit <a href="https://idp.fnvirtual.app/auth/login" target="_blank">this page</a>.
