**Q.  What internet browsers do you suggest for your platform?**

* FNvirtual works best in Chrome, Safari, Brave, and Firefox. To ensure you have a fast, safe, and secure internet experience, please verify your preferred browser is up to date.

<br><br>

**Q. What is an FNid?** 

* Your FNid is a set of credentials that authenticates you as a user of the FNvirtual Event Platform. When you create your FNid, you enter basic info about yourself and create a password to protect your info. You will use your FNid to access all FNvirtual Events. 

<br><br>

**Q. I created my FNid; why do I need to register for the event as well?**

* Creating an FNid and registering/purchasing an event ticket are two different things. 

  * Think of your FNid like a virtual ID card. These credentials tell the system you are you and permit access to FNvirtual registered events. (On the day of the event, you will simply log in with your FNid credentials; the system will know if you purchased an event ticket because it will be linked to your FNid.)
  * When you register/purchase an event ticket, you are gaining access to the event itself. Just like you would not be permitted entry to an in-person event without your printed badge, you will not be allowed to enter an FNvirtual event without a valid virtual ticket to that specific event. This step must be completed prior to attending each event. 
  * Please use the same email address for each event by signing into your FNid account during the registration process. 

<br><br>

**Q. Can I log into an event without an FNid?** 

* You may use a single-use login code or one of the social media authorizations (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Apple) to enter the event. **IMPORTANT:** The system uses your email address to identify you, so please be sure to use a social media platform that utilizes the SAME EMAIL that you used to register for the event! 

<br><br>

**Q.  What is a single-use login code?** 

* This is an alternative option which allows attendees to use a single-use login code to access the event, rather than logging in with a passcode or social media login. 
* When you choose this option, we will email you a single-use login code. You must use the same email address you provided when you registered for the event in order to receive the code. (This is frequently a business email address.) 

  * You will receive an email with the subject line: “Your Verification Code” 
  * The code will only be valid for 10 minutes
  * Each time you use this login option, you must request a new verification code

<br><br>

**Q.  Why am I being asked to allow the Virtual Event app to access my information after I log in for the first time?**  

* In accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines, the website is providing details on how it may use your information. This is standard industry practice. 

<br><br>

**Q. I forgot my FNid login/password**

* Please visit <https://idp.fnvirtual.app/>.

  * Type in your email address.
  * Choose “Reset my password” from the next screen. 
  * Follow the process to receive your password.   
  * You will receive an email—at whatever email address you used to create your FNid—which will allow you to reset your password.

<br><br>

**Q.  I’m having trouble with my FNid. Who should I contact?** 

* For tech support, please email [support@fntech.com](mailto:support@fntech.com) 

<br><br>

**Q.  I’m having trouble registering for an event. Who should I contact?**  

* For FNregistration support, please email [events@strava.com](mailto:events@strava.com). Please be sure to indicate which event you’re attending.  

<br><br>

**Q.  I’m looking for my virtual “ticket” to an event.** 

**OR - I’m looking for my event order.** 

**OR - I know the event url, but can’t find my ticket. How can I enter the event?** 

**Where can I find this?**  

* After you registered/purchased your ticket, you should have received an Order Confirmation email that contained this digital ticket. 

  * If you don’t remember receiving your Order Confirmation email, please check your Junk/Spam folder for a message from the event.  
  * Alternatively, you can find your ticket on the top navigation bar next to your profile photo after you log in (see “My Orders/Tickets”). Be sure to use the same email address that you provided when you registered for the event.
  * For additional FNregistration support, please email [events@strava.com](mailto:events@strava.com)[](mailto:registration@fntech.com) and be sure to indicate which event you’re attending. 

<br><br>

**Q.  The event page says, “I’m sorry, you are not registered for the event,” but I have an FNid. Why am I unable to enter the event?** 

* Each FNvirtual event requires a separate registration/ticket for that specific event. The event website will redirect you to event registration so you can purchase this ticket. 

  * You will be asked to log in using your FNid or a social authorization (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.). You may also request to have a single-use authorization code emailed to you. **IMPORTANT:** Be sure to use the same email address that you provided when you registered for the event.
  * Once you finish registering (purchasing your ticket), you will be able to enter the event with your FNid credentials, social authorization, or single-use login code. 
  * You will need to return to the event URL to enter.
