The 2023 OCP Regional Summit will be held in person 19-20 April, 2023 at the Prague Congress Centre, a fantastic facility overlooking the picturesque city of Prague. The capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated hourly show. Completed in 1402, the Charles pedestrian Bridge is lined with statues of Catholic saints. Prague is a wonderous destination, centrally located and easily accessed.

Following in the footsteps of the annual OCP Global Summit, the demand for OCP in Europe is greater than ever, while the regional challenges to the data center infrastructure multiply.

The OCP Future Technologies Symposium, occurring during the OCP Regional Summit, will continue to build on its momentum, bringing together research organizations, academia, as well as startup and investor communities, to solve longer-term challenges facing the technology infrastructure.
